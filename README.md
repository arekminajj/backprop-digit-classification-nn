# Backpropagation Digit Classification Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network for digit classification using backpropagation. It is designed to be trained from the MNIST dataset. The project is implemented in C++ using the Eigen library for matrix operations.

## Features

- **Backpropagation:** Implements the backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network.
- **Customizable Architecture:** Allows customization of the number of layers and neurons in the network.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Optimizes the network using the SGD method.
